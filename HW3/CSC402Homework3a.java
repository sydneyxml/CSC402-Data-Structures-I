 * This is a skeleton file for your homework. Edit the sections marked TODO. 
 *
 * You must not change the declaration of any method. This will be true of every
 * skeleton file I give you.
 *
 * For example, you would get zero points if you change the line
 * <pre>
 *     public static double minValue (double[] list) {
 * </pre>
 * to something like
 * <pre>
 *     public static void minValue (double[] list) {
 * </pre>
 * or
 * <pre>
 *     public static double minValue (double[] list, int i) {
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Each of the functions below is meant to be SELF CONTAINED. This means that
 * you should use no other functions or classes unless otherwise indicated. 
 * You should not use any HashSets or ArrayLists, or anything else! 
 * In addition, each of your functions should go
 * through the argument array at most once. The only exception to this is
 * removeDuplicates, which is allowed to call numDuplicates and then go through the
 * array once after that.
